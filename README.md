# single-spa Examples

Example codes for [single-spa](https://github.com/single-spa) project and sub-projects.
Includes both working examples and error reproduction.

This repository is **not**:
* Official (by single-spa team)
* Trying to present all scenarios
* Following all single-spa or other libraries versions
* Proof of anything
* Always following the recommended setup and best practices
* Always right, maybe not event most of the time

This repository is:
* Representing my personal needs and preferences
* A guide to help you get started and see what I got right (or wrong)
* Usually following the recommended setup and best practices
* A laboratory to experiment on solutions
* Currently focused on Angular and single-spa-angular

Each building block or scenario is placed on a different branch.

**Follow git log** to see each step used to build the scenario and understand the reason for each
change.
I am no longer building a summary doc since it is more work than building the example itself.

For the same reason I am not including error documentation here anymore.
All the required information should be in the issue I linked this code from.

To all single-spa team and community.
